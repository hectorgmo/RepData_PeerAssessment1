## Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(suppressWarnings(library(data.table)))
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dtplyr)))

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```r
    total_steps <- activity[,.(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = T)), by =date]
    
    hist(total_steps$total_steps, col = "red",
         xlab = "Total Steps", main = "Total Steps Histogram")
```

```r
    (total_steps[,mean(total_steps)]) # Mean steps per day
```

```
## [1] 9354.23
```

```r
    (total_steps[,median(total_steps)]) # Median steps per day
```

```
## [1] 10395
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```r
        average_steps <- activity[,.(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = T)), by =date]
        
        ggthemr("pale")
        ggplot(average_steps, aes(x = date, y = average_steps)) +
            geom_line() + xlab("Interval") + ylab("Average Steps") +
            ggtitle("Average number of steps") 
```

## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_path).

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```r
        weekend_ <- c("sÃ¡bado","domingo")
        activity[!weekdays(date) %in% weekend_, day_type:= "Weekday"]
        activity[weekdays(date) %in% weekend_, day_type:= "Weekend"]
        activity[, day_type:= as.factor(day_type)]

        average_steps_daytype <- activity[,.(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = T)), 
                                          by =.(interval, day_type)]
        
        ggplot(average_steps_daytype, aes(x = interval, y = average_steps)) +
            geom_line() + facet_grid(day_type~.) + ylab("Average Steps") + xlab("Interval") +
            ggtitle("Number of steps")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
        # The number of steps in the weekends seems to be higher, indicating more activity 
```
